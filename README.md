# beginning
first project on github

The project was to create a calculator of sorts. 
The program is designed to get an input of the initial investment amount along with the how much is deposited monthly, 
and the annual interest amount. The number of years is then added, and the result shows what the year end balance would be. 
Next the program shows the balance with interest added. 

The part of the code that was done well was that the code ran and displayed the proper way resulting in my first successful 
program that ran the way that it was suppose to.

The code could have been perfected by inserting the definitions into a seperate cpp file as well as including a header file.

The part of the code that I found to be the most challenging was creating a header file and tying all of the files together. The program that 
I completed after this one I was able to combine the files 

The part of the project that will be transferable to future projects is the ability to pay better attention to detail. The first project
that I did; did not follow the way the company wanted the project to run and the resulting grade reflected it.
